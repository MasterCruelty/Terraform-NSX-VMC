# What is this?

An IAC(Infrastructure as Code) approach to build your VMware NSX infrastructure using Terraform. The specific purpose this project achieve is the case you have to migrate an on-prem VMware infrastructure to a VMware on Cloud on AWS. Thanks to this approach, it's not necessary to manual migrate, but you can just adjust this code to your case and run it by Terraform cli.
The json example files you'll find here are in the same format of what you would obtain using this [tool](https://github.com/awslabs/import-export-for-nsx).
